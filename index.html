        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at KNUST with a strong passion for energy sustainability and growing expertise in programming. My experiences—ranging from leading the TUM SEED society, participating in an energy conference in Kenya, to interning with an organization in Germany—have shown me how data and software are transforming the energy sector. Motivated by this, I am developing my programming skills to complement my engineering background. I aspire to pursue graduate studies focused on smart grids, energy analytics, and sustainable systems, equipping me to apply data-driven solutions to strengthen Ghana’s energy sector.</p>
